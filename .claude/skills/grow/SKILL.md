  Productize grow playbook for stable products with activation evidence. Use when the product
  has a working core and the team needs growth diagnosis, growth loops, GTM choices,
  onboarding, retention, pricing, lifecycle triggers, and experiment cadence.

# Productize Grow

## Productize Preamble

Before producing the artifact, implementation step, or code change, classify the work:

- **User/persona**: founder, product leader, AI PM, AI builder, stakeholder, or mixed/unknown.
- **Product stage**: idea, validation, PMF search, growth, scale, pivot, or unknown.
- **Artifact mode**: strategy memo, PRD, research plan, positioning, experiment, deck, roadmap, execution brief, diagnostic, or decision record.
- **Artifact format**: Markdown for short, repo-native, diff-sensitive artifacts; self-contained HTML for long, visual, shareable, interactive, or explicitly requested artifacts.
- **Evidence standard**: what is known, assumed, missing, and risky.
- **Decision mode**: recommend, ask for a blocking input, or proceed with explicit assumptions.

Operating rules:

1. Do not produce generic product strategy filler. Tie every recommendation to the user's context, evidence, stage, and decision pressure.
2. Separate facts from assumptions. Convert high-risk assumptions into tests, research prompts, or instrumentation.
3. Search existing context, attached docs, repo files, or prior Productize artifacts before inventing new structure when those sources are available.
4. Ask only for inputs that materially change the output. If the next step is obvious, proceed and state assumptions.
5. If another Productize skill is a better fit, name it and explain the routing in one sentence before continuing.
6. Enforce the output contract for this skill. Produce the artifact, implementation step, verification evidence, or code change; do not stop at a meta-explanation of the method.
7. End with the concrete next action, decision owner, validation step, metric, or artifact handoff when applicable.
8. Use the user's saved Productize preferences when available, but do not let stale preferences override explicit instructions in the current request.
9. If you must ask a blocking question, use this compact format: `AskUserQuestion: <one question> Why it matters: <decision it changes>`.
10. Record completion status for durable work as `completed`, `blocked`, `deferred`, or `needs-review` when runtime hooks are available.

Artifact format policy:

- Default to Markdown for short notes, repo-native documentation, changelog fragments, or artifacts where clean source diffs matter.
- Use a self-contained HTML file when the user asks for HTML, the artifact is likely to exceed about 100 lines, the reader needs diagrams/tables/comparisons/screenshots, the artifact is meant to be shared, or interaction/export controls would help the user stay in the loop.
- Route by product job first, then choose the format. Do not create a generic HTML workflow when a Productize playbook, reviewer, or routed skill owns the work.
- HTML artifacts must be local-first and portable: one file, embedded CSS/JS, no remote dependencies unless explicitly requested, readable without a dev server, responsive, accessible, and easy to skim.
- Prefer semantic sections, tables, SVG diagrams, annotated code blocks, status chips, collapsible detail, and copy/export buttons when they improve review speed. Avoid decorative complexity that hides the decision.
- For implementation work with ambiguities, use `$implementation-notes` when the user asks for a running notes file, especially `implementation-notes.html` or `implementation-notes.md`.

Runtime hooks, if available:

- Use `productize-workflow start "<user request>"` at the beginning of durable product work; it restores context, routes the request, records the session, and returns the required artifact contract.
- Use `productize-workflow complete --id <id> --status completed|blocked|deferred|needs-review --artifact-type <type> --summary <summary>` before ending durable product work; it records the artifact, saves context, and logs completion status.
- Use `productize-update-check --strict` at the start of maintenance, setup, release, or generated-output work.
- Use `productize-config` to read or write user/team preferences such as persona, artifact mode, evidence threshold, or update-check policy.
- Use `productize-session-log` to record important workflow decisions.
- Use `productize-artifact-log` when a durable artifact is produced.
- Use `productize-context-restore` before restarting long-running product work from scratch.
- Use `productize-context-save` after producing a durable strategy, research, spec, or stakeholder artifact.
- Use `productize-registry-search` or `productize-skill-router` when routing is ambiguous.
- Use `productize-completion-status` to log whether the workflow completed, blocked, deferred, or needs review.

Telemetry standard:

- Keep telemetry local by default in `.productize/` or `PRODUCTIZE_STATE_DIR`.
- Log artifact type, routing decision, evidence gaps, and completion status; do not log secrets or private customer data unless the user explicitly asks for it.

Current skill metadata:

- **Skill**: `grow`
- **Lifecycle**: Growth
- **Category**: Growth
- **Primary artifact**: Growth playbook with activation evidence, bottleneck diagnosis, experiment cadence, gate calls, and closure condition

Use this playbook when the core product is stable enough to grow. Grow is not the
place to invent the product; use `$0-1` for new bets and `$operate` for continuous
production health.

## Cadence

- Trigger: stable activation, repeat usage, clear ICP, or a growth bottleneck.
- Rhythm: weekly experiment planning and readout, with metric reviews before changing
  channels, onboarding, pricing, or lifecycle triggers.
- Closure: target hit, target abandoned, strategy pivot, or evidence that the product
  needs a new `$0-1` loop.

## Route Internally

- Product-market fit and bottlenecks: `$product-market-fit-cycle`, `$aarrr-growth-diagnostics`, `$metrics-review`
- Loops and experiments: `$growth-loops`, `$plg-growth-playbook`, `$growth-project-generation-with-pioneer-migrator-settler`, `$robust-experiment-design-from-goals-and-systems`
- GTM and lifecycle: `$gtm-motions`, `$gtm-strategy`, `$onboarding-flow-optimization-from-product-data-to-user-success`
- Retention and monetization: `$churn-reduction-from-customer-data-and-exit-survey-analysis`, `$pricing-strategy`, `$monetization-strategy`
- Gates: `$product-review`, `$qa`, `$comms-review`, `$docs`, `$release`

## Required Output

Return:

1. **Growth State**: ICP, activation evidence, retention signal, bottleneck, and metric caveats.
2. **Growth Thesis**: target, growth loop, channel or lifecycle trigger, and why it fits the current evidence.
3. **Experiment Cadence**: tests, owners, sample size or evidence threshold, and stop/pivot rules.
4. **Gate Calls**: product, QA, docs, release, or comms gates needed before launch.
5. **Closure Condition**: target hit, pivot, pause, or new `$0-1` bet.

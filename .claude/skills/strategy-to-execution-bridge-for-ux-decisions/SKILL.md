# Strategy-to-execution bridge for UX decisions

## Productize Preamble

Before producing the artifact, implementation step, or code change, classify the work:

- **User/persona**: founder, product leader, AI PM, AI builder, stakeholder, or mixed/unknown.
- **Product stage**: idea, validation, PMF search, growth, scale, pivot, or unknown.
- **Artifact mode**: strategy memo, PRD, research plan, positioning, experiment, deck, roadmap, execution brief, diagnostic, or decision record.
- **Artifact format**: Markdown for short, repo-native, diff-sensitive artifacts; self-contained HTML for long, visual, shareable, interactive, or explicitly requested artifacts.
- **Evidence standard**: what is known, assumed, missing, and risky.
- **Decision mode**: recommend, ask for a blocking input, or proceed with explicit assumptions.

Operating rules:

1. Do not produce generic product strategy filler. Tie every recommendation to the user's context, evidence, stage, and decision pressure.
2. Separate facts from assumptions. Convert high-risk assumptions into tests, research prompts, or instrumentation.
3. Search existing context, attached docs, repo files, or prior Productize artifacts before inventing new structure when those sources are available.
4. Ask only for inputs that materially change the output. If the next step is obvious, proceed and state assumptions.
5. If another Productize skill is a better fit, name it and explain the routing in one sentence before continuing.
6. Enforce the output contract for this skill. Produce the artifact, implementation step, verification evidence, or code change; do not stop at a meta-explanation of the method.
7. End with the concrete next action, decision owner, validation step, metric, or artifact handoff when applicable.
8. Use the user's saved Productize preferences when available, but do not let stale preferences override explicit instructions in the current request.
9. If you must ask a blocking question, use this compact format: `AskUserQuestion: <one question> Why it matters: <decision it changes>`.
10. Record completion status for durable work as `completed`, `blocked`, `deferred`, or `needs-review` when runtime hooks are available.

Artifact format policy:

- Default to Markdown for short notes, repo-native documentation, changelog fragments, or artifacts where clean source diffs matter.
- Use a self-contained HTML file when the user asks for HTML, the artifact is likely to exceed about 100 lines, the reader needs diagrams/tables/comparisons/screenshots, the artifact is meant to be shared, or interaction/export controls would help the user stay in the loop.
- Route by product job first, then choose the format. Do not create a generic HTML workflow when a Productize playbook, gate, or routed skill owns the work.
- HTML artifacts must be local-first and portable: one file, embedded CSS/JS, no remote dependencies unless explicitly requested, readable without a dev server, responsive, accessible, and easy to skim.
- Prefer semantic sections, tables, SVG diagrams, annotated code blocks, status chips, collapsible detail, and copy/export buttons when they improve review speed. Avoid decorative complexity that hides the decision.
- For implementation work with ambiguities, use `$implementation-notes` when the user asks for a running notes file, especially `implementation-notes.html` or `implementation-notes.md`.

Runtime hooks, if available:

- Use `productize-workflow start "<user request>"` at the beginning of durable product work; it restores context, routes the request, records the session, and returns the required artifact contract.
- Use `productize-workflow complete --id <id> --status completed|blocked|deferred|needs-review --artifact-type <type> --summary <summary>` before ending durable product work; it records the artifact, saves context, and logs completion status.
- Use `productize-update-check --strict` at the start of maintenance, setup, release, or generated-output work.
- Use `productize-config` to read or write user/team preferences such as persona, artifact mode, evidence threshold, or update-check policy.
- Use `productize-session-log` to record important workflow decisions.
- Use `productize-artifact-log` when a durable artifact is produced.
- Use `productize-context-restore` before restarting long-running product work from scratch.
- Use `productize-context-save` after producing a durable strategy, research, spec, or stakeholder artifact.
- Use `productize-registry-search` or `productize-skill-router` when routing is ambiguous.
- Use `productize-completion-status` to log whether the workflow completed, blocked, deferred, or needs review.

Telemetry standard:

- Keep telemetry local by default in `.productize/` or `PRODUCTIZE_STATE_DIR`.
- Log artifact type, routing decision, evidence gaps, and completion status; do not log secrets or private customer data unless the user explicitly asks for it.

Current skill metadata:

- **Skill**: `strategy-to-execution-bridge-for-ux-decisions`
- **Lifecycle**: Strategize
- **Category**: Strategy
- **Primary artifact**: Strategy-to-execution bridge for UX decisions strategy memo with choices, tradeoffs, risks, and recommended next move

## Daily Design Decision Criteria

[Questions to ask when making design choices to ensure vision alignment]

### When Choosing Between Design Alternatives

1. **Vision alignment check:** Which option better advances strategic themes [list themes]?
   - Option A: [How it aligns or conflicts]
   - Option B: [How it aligns or conflicts]
   - Winner: [Which to choose and why]

2. **Scalability evaluation:** Which option extends to future use cases implied by vision?
   - Consider: [Upcoming features or use cases]
   - Test: [Can this pattern handle those scenarios?]

3. **Consistency assessment:** Which option reinforces established patterns vs. introducing divergence?
   - If new pattern is needed: [Justify with strategic rationale]
   - If consistency conflicts with vision: [Escalate or document tradeoff]

4. **User value prioritization:** Which option prioritizes user needs over internal convenience?
   - Red flag: [Designs optimized for engineering simplicity or business politics over UX]

5. **Technical feasibility reality check:** Is this implementable within constraints?
   - If not: [Adjust design or advocate for constraint removal]
   - If workaround needed: [Ensure workaround doesn't degrade UX]

### When Vision and Immediate Needs Conflict

**Favor vision if:**
- Immediate need is temporary or can be solved another way
- Vision direction is high-confidence and well-validated
- Technical debt from immediate solution is significant

**Favor immediate need if:**
- Blocker for users or business (not just internal inconvenience)
- Vision direction is uncertain or likely to change
- Can be implemented without major technical debt

**Seek creative middle ground:**
- Phased rollout (simple now, vision-aligned later)
- Feature flags (ship both, test and learn)
- Modular design (immediate solution doesn't preclude vision path)

**Escalate when:**
- Tradeoff has significant strategic implications
- Decision affects multiple teams or long-term architecture
- Stakeholder alignment is needed

### Pattern Establishment vs. Deferral

**Standardize now if:**
- Pattern will be used in 3+ places imminently
- Consistency is critical for usability (e.g., error handling, form validation)
- Foundation for other patterns (e.g., base components)

**Defer standardization if:**
- Single-use or rare use case
- Vision direction unclear and pattern may change
- Pattern is experimental and needs validation first

**Create flexible pattern if:**
- Vision direction uncertain but action needed now
- Multiple future variations likely
- Learning required before locking in specific implementation

### Scope Management

**When new requests arise outside quarterly plan:**

1. **Does this directly advance a Q1 vision element?**
   - Yes → Evaluate against current priorities
   - No → Default to defer unless exception criteria met

2. **Exception criteria:**
   - Critical user blocker (cannot accomplish core tasks)
   - Regulatory or legal requirement
   - Foundational for Q2+ work (pull forward)
   - Opportunistic (very low effort, high strategic value)

3. **If considering inclusion, ask: What would we deprioritize?**
   - Evaluate tradeoff explicitly
   - Ensure swapped item is truly lower priority
   - Get stakeholder alignment on change

4. **Can this be achieved with existing patterns?**
   - Yes → Lower cost, more likely to include
   - No → Higher bar for inclusion

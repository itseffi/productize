# Multiple interface descriptions from a single image

## Productize Preamble

Before producing the artifact, implementation step, or code change, classify the work:

- **User/persona**: founder, product leader, AI PM, AI builder, stakeholder, or mixed/unknown.
- **Product stage**: idea, validation, PMF search, growth, scale, pivot, or unknown.
- **Artifact mode**: strategy memo, PRD, research plan, positioning, experiment, deck, roadmap, execution brief, diagnostic, or decision record.
- **Artifact format**: Markdown for short, repo-native, diff-sensitive artifacts; self-contained HTML for long, visual, shareable, interactive, or explicitly requested artifacts.
- **Evidence standard**: what is known, assumed, missing, and risky.
- **Decision mode**: recommend, ask for a blocking input, or proceed with explicit assumptions.

Operating rules:

1. Do not produce generic product strategy filler. Tie every recommendation to the user's context, evidence, stage, and decision pressure.
2. Separate facts from assumptions. Convert high-risk assumptions into tests, research prompts, or instrumentation.
3. Search existing context, attached docs, repo files, or prior Productize artifacts before inventing new structure when those sources are available.
4. Ask only for inputs that materially change the output. If the next step is obvious, proceed and state assumptions.
5. If another Productize skill is a better fit, name it and explain the routing in one sentence before continuing.
6. Enforce the output contract for this skill. Produce the artifact, implementation step, verification evidence, or code change; do not stop at a meta-explanation of the method.
7. End with the concrete next action, decision owner, validation step, metric, or artifact handoff when applicable.
8. Use the user's saved Productize preferences when available, but do not let stale preferences override explicit instructions in the current request.
9. If you must ask a blocking question, use this compact format: `AskUserQuestion: <one question> Why it matters: <decision it changes>`.
10. Record completion status for durable work as `completed`, `blocked`, `deferred`, or `needs-review` when runtime hooks are available.

Artifact format policy:

- Default to Markdown for short notes, repo-native documentation, changelog fragments, or artifacts where clean source diffs matter.
- Use a self-contained HTML file when the user asks for HTML, the artifact is likely to exceed about 100 lines, the reader needs diagrams/tables/comparisons/screenshots, the artifact is meant to be shared, or interaction/export controls would help the user stay in the loop.
- Route by product job first, then choose the format. Do not create a generic HTML workflow when a Productize playbook, reviewer, or routed skill owns the work.
- HTML artifacts must be local-first and portable: one file, embedded CSS/JS, no remote dependencies unless explicitly requested, readable without a dev server, responsive, accessible, and easy to skim.
- Prefer semantic sections, tables, SVG diagrams, annotated code blocks, status chips, collapsible detail, and copy/export buttons when they improve review speed. Avoid decorative complexity that hides the decision.
- For implementation work with ambiguities, use `$implementation-notes` when the user asks for a running notes file, especially `implementation-notes.html` or `implementation-notes.md`.

Runtime hooks, if available:

- Use `productize-workflow start "<user request>"` at the beginning of durable product work; it restores context, routes the request, records the session, and returns the required artifact contract.
- Use `productize-workflow complete --id <id> --status completed|blocked|deferred|needs-review --artifact-type <type> --summary <summary>` before ending durable product work; it records the artifact, saves context, and logs completion status.
- Use `productize-update-check --strict` at the start of maintenance, setup, release, or generated-output work.
- Use `productize-config` to read or write user/team preferences such as persona, artifact mode, evidence threshold, or update-check policy.
- Use `productize-session-log` to record important workflow decisions.
- Use `productize-artifact-log` when a durable artifact is produced.
- Use `productize-context-restore` before restarting long-running product work from scratch.
- Use `productize-context-save` after producing a durable strategy, research, spec, or stakeholder artifact.
- Use `productize-registry-search` or `productize-skill-router` when routing is ambiguous.
- Use `productize-completion-status` to log whether the workflow completed, blocked, deferred, or needs review.

Telemetry standard:

- Keep telemetry local by default in `.productize/` or `PRODUCTIZE_STATE_DIR`.
- Log artifact type, routing decision, evidence gaps, and completion status; do not log secrets or private customer data unless the user explicitly asks for it.

Current skill metadata:

- **Skill**: `multiple-interface-descriptions-from-a-single-image`
- **Lifecycle**: Design
- **Category**: Design
- **Primary artifact**: Multiple interface descriptions from a single image UX/design review with findings, constraints, fixes, and acceptance checks

Use this skill to run the Productize prompt contract for **Multiple interface descriptions from a single image**.

## Instructions

1. Treat every `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` in the contract as an input to collect, infer, or mark as missing.
2. If missing information blocks useful work, ask only for the blocking inputs. If work can proceed, state assumptions explicitly.
3. Follow the contract's `GOAL`, `CONSTRAINTS`, `FORMAT`, and `FAILURE` clauses exactly.
4. Preserve the required output schema unless the user explicitly asks for a different artifact.
5. Keep claims grounded in the provided inputs and disclose gaps.

## Prompt Contract

INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- {{IMAGE}}
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: "Multiple interface descriptions from a single image".
Success metric:
- Completes all required tasks and decision logic from the prompt instructions.
- Output is specific, evidence-based, and actionable.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required analysis steps, sections, or validation logic.
- Keep recommendations/outputs grounded in the input context; avoid generic filler.
- Follow these task requirements:
<task_requirements>
You will be given an image of the interface for a complex tool. Your task is to describe this interface in four different ways. Here's how to proceed:

First, examine the image carefully:
<image>
{{IMAGE}}
</image>

Now, follow these steps:

1. Write instructions for a novice:  
   Analyze the image and write clear, step-by-step instructions for a beginner to understand and use the interface. Use simple language and explain each element of the interface. Begin your response with `<novice_instructions>` and end with `</novice_instructions>`.

2. Create a process diagram:  
   Based on your analysis of the image, create a textual representation of a process diagram. Use symbols like `[ ]` for steps, `( )` for decisions, and `->` for connections. Describe the flow of using the interface in a logical order. Begin your response with `<process_diagram>` and end with `</process_diagram>`.

3. Write like a 5th grader doing a book report:  
   Imagine you're a 5th grader writing a book report about this interface. Use simple vocabulary, short sentences, and an excited tone. Describe what you see and what you think it does. Begin your response with `<fifth_grader_report>` and end with `</fifth_grader_report>`.

4. Write for someone terminally online:  
   Rewrite your description for someone who spends all their time on the internet. Use internet slang, memes, and references. Be informal and use exaggerated language. Begin your response with ``.

Remember to base all your descriptions on the image provided. Do not invent features or elements that are not visible in the image. If you're unsure about any aspect of the interface, it's okay to say so in your descriptions.
</task_requirements>

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<online_description>` and end with `</online_description>

FAILURE
- Output misses required sections, steps, or reasoning required by `<task_requirements>`.
- Required format/schema is missing, malformed, or incomplete.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.

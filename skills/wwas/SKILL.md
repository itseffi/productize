# Why-What-Acceptance

## Productize Preamble

Before producing the artifact, implementation step, or code change, classify the work:

- **User/persona**: founder, product leader, AI PM, AI builder, stakeholder, or mixed/unknown.
- **Product stage**: idea, validation, PMF search, growth, scale, pivot, or unknown.
- **Artifact mode**: strategy memo, PRD, research plan, positioning, experiment, deck, roadmap, execution brief, diagnostic, or decision record.
- **Artifact format**: Markdown for short, repo-native, diff-sensitive artifacts; self-contained HTML for long, visual, shareable, interactive, or explicitly requested artifacts.
- **Evidence standard**: what is known, assumed, missing, and risky.
- **Decision mode**: recommend, ask for a blocking input, or proceed with explicit assumptions.

Operating rules:

1. Do not produce generic product strategy filler. Tie every recommendation to the user's context, evidence, stage, and decision pressure.
2. Separate facts from assumptions. Convert high-risk assumptions into tests, research prompts, or instrumentation.
3. Search existing context, attached docs, repo files, or prior Productize artifacts before inventing new structure when those sources are available.
4. Ask only for inputs that materially change the output. If the next step is obvious, proceed and state assumptions.
5. If another Productize skill is a better fit, name it and explain the routing in one sentence before continuing.
6. Enforce the output contract for this skill. Produce the artifact, implementation step, verification evidence, or code change; do not stop at a meta-explanation of the method.
7. End with the concrete next action, decision owner, validation step, metric, or artifact handoff when applicable.
8. Use the user's saved Productize preferences when available, but do not let stale preferences override explicit instructions in the current request.
9. If you must ask a blocking question, use this compact format: `AskUserQuestion: <one question> Why it matters: <decision it changes>`.
10. Record completion status for durable work as `completed`, `blocked`, `deferred`, or `needs-review` when runtime hooks are available.

Artifact format policy:

- Default to Markdown for short notes, repo-native documentation, changelog fragments, or artifacts where clean source diffs matter.
- Use a self-contained HTML file when the user asks for HTML, the artifact is likely to exceed about 100 lines, the reader needs diagrams/tables/comparisons/screenshots, the artifact is meant to be shared, or interaction/export controls would help the user stay in the loop.
- Route by product job first, then choose the format. Do not create a generic HTML workflow when a Productize playbook, reviewer, or routed skill owns the work.
- HTML artifacts must be local-first and portable: one file, embedded CSS/JS, no remote dependencies unless explicitly requested, readable without a dev server, responsive, accessible, and easy to skim.
- Prefer semantic sections, tables, SVG diagrams, annotated code blocks, status chips, collapsible detail, and copy/export buttons when they improve review speed. Avoid decorative complexity that hides the decision.
- For implementation work with ambiguities, use `$implementation-notes` when the user asks for a running notes file, especially `implementation-notes.html` or `implementation-notes.md`.

Runtime hooks, if available:

- Use `productize-workflow start "<user request>"` at the beginning of durable product work; it restores context, routes the request, records the session, and returns the required artifact contract.
- Use `productize-workflow complete --id <id> --status completed|blocked|deferred|needs-review --artifact-type <type> --summary <summary>` before ending durable product work; it records the artifact, saves context, and logs completion status.
- Use `productize-update-check --strict` at the start of maintenance, setup, release, or generated-output work.
- Use `productize-config` to read or write user/team preferences such as persona, artifact mode, evidence threshold, or update-check policy.
- Use `productize-session-log` to record important workflow decisions.
- Use `productize-artifact-log` when a durable artifact is produced.
- Use `productize-context-restore` before restarting long-running product work from scratch.
- Use `productize-context-save` after producing a durable strategy, research, spec, or stakeholder artifact.
- Use `productize-registry-search` or `productize-skill-router` when routing is ambiguous.
- Use `productize-completion-status` to log whether the workflow completed, blocked, deferred, or needs review.

Telemetry standard:

- Keep telemetry local by default in `.productize/` or `PRODUCTIZE_STATE_DIR`.
- Log artifact type, routing decision, evidence gaps, and completion status; do not log secrets or private customer data unless the user explicitly asks for it.

Current skill metadata:

- **Skill**: `wwas`
- **Lifecycle**: Plan
- **Category**: Delivery
- **Primary artifact**: Why-What-Acceptance backlog items with strategic context and acceptance criteria

Use when writing backlog items in Why-What-Acceptance format, breaking features into independent valuable work, or adding strategic context to delivery items.

## Productize Contract

- **Primary lifecycle**: Plan
- **Supporting lifecycle**: Build With AI
- **Primary artifact**: Why-What-Acceptance backlog items with strategic context and acceptance criteria
- **Source method**: pm-skills-main/pm-execution/skills/wwas/SKILL.md

## Method

Create product backlog items in Why-What-Acceptance format. Produces independent, valuable, testable items with strategic context.

**Use when:** Writing backlog items, creating product increments, breaking features into work items, or communicating strategic intent to teams.

**Arguments:**
- `$PRODUCT`: The product or system name
- `$FEATURE`: The new feature or capability
- `$DESIGN`: Link to design files (Figma, Miro, etc.)
- `$ASSUMPTIONS`: Key assumptions and strategic context

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Define the strategic Why** - Connect work to business and team objectives
2. **Describe the What** - Keep descriptions concise, reference designs
3. **Write Acceptance Criteria** - High-level, not detailed specifications
4. **Ensure independence** - Items can be developed in any order
5. **Keep items negotiable** - Invite team conversation, not constraints
6. **Make items valuable** - Each delivers measurable user or business value
7. **Ensure testability** - Outcomes are observable and verifiable
8. **Size appropriately** - Small enough for one sprint estimate

## Item Template

**Title:** [What will be delivered]

**Why:** [1-2 sentences connecting to strategic context and team objectives]

**What:** [Short description and design link. 1-2 paragraphs maximum. A reminder of discussion, not detailed specification.]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [Observable outcome 1]
- [Observable outcome 2]
- [Observable outcome 3]
- [Observable outcome 4]

## Example WWA Item

**Title:** Implement Real-Time Spending Tracker

**Why:** Users need immediate feedback on spending to make conscious budget decisions. This directly supports our goal to improve financial awareness and reduce overspending.

**What:** Add a real-time spending tracker that updates as users log expenses. The tracker displays their current week's spending against their set budget. Designs available in [Figma link]. This is a reminder of our discussions - detailed specifications will emerge during development conversations with the team.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Spending totals update within 2 seconds of logging an expense
- Budget progress is visually indicated with a progress bar
- Users can see remaining budget amount at a glance
- System handles multiple expense categories correctly

## Output Deliverables

- Complete set of backlog items for the feature
- Each item includes Why, What, and Acceptance Criteria sections
- Items are independent and deliverable in any order
- Items are sized for estimation and completion in one sprint
- Strategic context is clear for team decision-making
- Design references are included for implementation guidance

## Productize Output Rules

- Produce the artifact named in the Productize contract, not a generic framework summary.
- Separate known facts, assumptions, missing evidence, and risky leaps before recommending.
- Convert uncertain claims into validation steps, metrics, owner decisions, or launch/readout checks.
- If the PM source method conflicts with Productize evidence standards, keep the Productize standard.

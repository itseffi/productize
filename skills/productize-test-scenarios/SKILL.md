# Test Scenarios

## Productize Preamble

Before producing the artifact, implementation step, or code change, classify the work:

- **User/persona**: founder, product leader, AI PM, AI builder, stakeholder, or mixed/unknown.
- **Product stage**: idea, validation, PMF search, growth, scale, pivot, or unknown.
- **Artifact mode**: strategy memo, PRD, research plan, positioning, experiment, deck, roadmap, execution brief, diagnostic, or decision record.
- **Artifact format**: Markdown for short, repo-native, diff-sensitive artifacts; self-contained HTML for long, visual, shareable, interactive, or explicitly requested artifacts.
- **Evidence standard**: what is known, assumed, missing, and risky.
- **Decision mode**: recommend, ask for a blocking input, or proceed with explicit assumptions.

Operating rules:

1. Do not produce generic product strategy filler. Tie every recommendation to the user's context, evidence, stage, and decision pressure.
2. Separate facts from assumptions. Convert high-risk assumptions into tests, research prompts, or instrumentation.
3. Search existing context, attached docs, repo files, or prior Productize artifacts before inventing new structure when those sources are available.
4. Ask only for inputs that materially change the output. If the next step is obvious, proceed and state assumptions.
5. If another Productize skill is a better fit, name it and explain the routing in one sentence before continuing.
6. Enforce the output contract for this skill. Produce the artifact, implementation step, verification evidence, or code change; do not stop at a meta-explanation of the method.
7. End with the concrete next action, decision owner, validation step, metric, or artifact handoff when applicable.
8. Use the user's saved Productize preferences when available, but do not let stale preferences override explicit instructions in the current request.
9. If you must ask a blocking question, use this compact format: `AskUserQuestion: <one question> Why it matters: <decision it changes>`.
10. Record completion status for durable work as `completed`, `blocked`, `deferred`, or `needs-review` when runtime hooks are available.

Artifact format policy:

- Default to Markdown for short notes, repo-native documentation, changelog fragments, or artifacts where clean source diffs matter.
- Use a self-contained HTML file when the user asks for HTML, the artifact is likely to exceed about 100 lines, the reader needs diagrams/tables/comparisons/screenshots, the artifact is meant to be shared, or interaction/export controls would help the user stay in the loop.
- Route by product job first, then choose the format. Do not create a generic HTML workflow when a Productize playbook, gate, or routed skill owns the work.
- HTML artifacts must be local-first and portable: one file, embedded CSS/JS, no remote dependencies unless explicitly requested, readable without a dev server, responsive, accessible, and easy to skim.
- Prefer semantic sections, tables, SVG diagrams, annotated code blocks, status chips, collapsible detail, and copy/export buttons when they improve review speed. Avoid decorative complexity that hides the decision.
- For implementation work with ambiguities, use `$implementation-notes` when the user asks for a running notes file, especially `implementation-notes.html` or `implementation-notes.md`.

Runtime hooks, if available:

- Use `productize-workflow start "<user request>"` at the beginning of durable product work; it restores context, routes the request, records the session, and returns the required artifact contract.
- Use `productize-workflow complete --id <id> --status completed|blocked|deferred|needs-review --artifact-type <type> --summary <summary>` before ending durable product work; it records the artifact, saves context, and logs completion status.
- Use `productize-update-check --strict` at the start of maintenance, setup, release, or generated-output work.
- Use `productize-config` to read or write user/team preferences such as persona, artifact mode, evidence threshold, or update-check policy.
- Use `productize-session-log` to record important workflow decisions.
- Use `productize-artifact-log` when a durable artifact is produced.
- Use `productize-context-restore` before restarting long-running product work from scratch.
- Use `productize-context-save` after producing a durable strategy, research, spec, or stakeholder artifact.
- Use `productize-registry-search` or `productize-skill-router` when routing is ambiguous.
- Use `productize-completion-status` to log whether the workflow completed, blocked, deferred, or needs review.

Telemetry standard:

- Keep telemetry local by default in `.productize/` or `PRODUCTIZE_STATE_DIR`.
- Log artifact type, routing decision, evidence gaps, and completion status; do not log secrets or private customer data unless the user explicitly asks for it.

Current skill metadata:

- **Skill**: `test-scenarios`
- **Lifecycle**: Build With AI

## Productize Contract

- **Primary lifecycle**: Build With AI
- **Supporting lifecycle**: Launch & Learn
- **Primary artifact**: QA-ready test scenarios with roles, preconditions, steps, expected outcomes, and coverage matrix
- **Source method**: pm-skills-main/pm-execution/skills/test-scenarios/SKILL.md

## Method

Create comprehensive test scenarios from user stories with test objectives, starting conditions, user roles, step-by-step test actions, and expected outcomes.

**Use when:** Writing QA test cases, creating test plans, defining acceptance test scenarios, or validating user story implementations.

**Arguments:**
- `$PRODUCT`: The product or system name
- `$USER_STORY`: The user story to test (title and acceptance criteria)
- `$CONTEXT`: Additional testing context or constraints

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Review the user story** and acceptance criteria
2. **Define test objectives** - What specific behavior to validate
3. **Establish starting conditions** - System state, data setup, configurations
4. **Identify user roles** - Who performs the test actions
5. **Create test steps** - Break down interactions step-by-step
6. **Define expected outcomes** - Observable results after each step
7. **Consider edge cases** - Invalid inputs, boundary conditions
8. **Output detailed test scenarios** - Ready for QA execution

## Scenario Template

**Test Scenario:** [Clear scenario name]

**Test Objective:** [What this test validates]

**Starting Conditions:**
- [System state required]
- [Data or configuration needed]
- [User setup or permissions]

**User Role:** [Who performs the test]

**Test Steps:**
1. [First action and its expected result]
2. [Second action and observable outcome]
3. [Third action and system behavior]
4. [Completion action and final state]

**Expected Outcomes:**
- [Observable result 1]
- [Observable result 2]
- [Observable result 3]

## Example Test Scenario

**Test Scenario:** View Recently Viewed Products on Product Page

**Test Objective:** Verify that the 'Recently viewed' section displays correctly and excludes the current product.

**Starting Conditions:**
- User is logged in or has browser history enabled
- User has viewed at least 2 products in the current session
- User is now on a product page different from previously viewed items

**User Role:** Online Shopper

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to any product page -> Section should appear at bottom with previously viewed items
2. Scroll to bottom of page -> "Recently viewed" section is visible with product cards
3. Verify product thumbnails -> Images, titles, and prices are displayed correctly
4. Check current product -> Current product is NOT in the recently viewed list
5. Click on a product card -> User navigates to the corresponding product page

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Recently viewed section appears only after viewing at least 1 prior product
- Section displays 4-8 product cards with complete information
- Current product is excluded from the list
- Each card shows "Viewed X minutes/hours ago" timestamp
- Clicking cards navigates to correct product pages
- Performance: Section loads within 2 seconds

## Output Deliverables

- Comprehensive test scenarios for each acceptance criterion
- Clear test objectives aligned with user story intent
- Detailed step-by-step test actions
- Observable expected outcomes after each step
- Edge case and error scenario coverage
- Ready for QA team execution and documentation

## Productize Output Rules

- Produce the artifact named in the Productize contract, not a generic framework summary.
- Separate known facts, assumptions, missing evidence, and risky leaps before recommending.
- Convert uncertain claims into validation steps, metrics, owner decisions, or launch/readout checks.
- If this reference method conflicts with Productize evidence standards, keep the Productize standard.

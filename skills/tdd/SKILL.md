# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Productize Preamble

Before producing the artifact, implementation step, or code change, classify the work:

- **User/persona**: founder, product leader, AI PM, AI builder, stakeholder, or mixed/unknown.
- **Product stage**: idea, validation, PMF search, growth, scale, pivot, or unknown.
- **Artifact mode**: strategy memo, PRD, research plan, positioning, experiment, deck, roadmap, execution brief, diagnostic, or decision record.
- **Artifact format**: Markdown for short, repo-native, diff-sensitive artifacts; self-contained HTML for long, visual, shareable, interactive, or explicitly requested artifacts.
- **Evidence standard**: what is known, assumed, missing, and risky.
- **Decision mode**: recommend, ask for a blocking input, or proceed with explicit assumptions.

Operating rules:

1. Do not produce generic product strategy filler. Tie every recommendation to the user's context, evidence, stage, and decision pressure.
2. Separate facts from assumptions. Convert high-risk assumptions into tests, research prompts, or instrumentation.
3. Search existing context, attached docs, repo files, or prior Productize artifacts before inventing new structure when those sources are available.
4. Ask only for inputs that materially change the output. If the next step is obvious, proceed and state assumptions.
5. If another Productize skill is a better fit, name it and explain the routing in one sentence before continuing.
6. Enforce the output contract for this skill. Produce the artifact, implementation step, verification evidence, or code change; do not stop at a meta-explanation of the method.
7. End with the concrete next action, decision owner, validation step, metric, or artifact handoff when applicable.
8. Use the user's saved Productize preferences when available, but do not let stale preferences override explicit instructions in the current request.
9. If you must ask a blocking question, use this compact format: `AskUserQuestion: <one question> Why it matters: <decision it changes>`.
10. Record completion status for durable work as `completed`, `blocked`, `deferred`, or `needs-review` when runtime hooks are available.

Artifact format policy:

- Default to Markdown for short notes, repo-native documentation, changelog fragments, or artifacts where clean source diffs matter.
- Use a self-contained HTML file when the user asks for HTML, the artifact is likely to exceed about 100 lines, the reader needs diagrams/tables/comparisons/screenshots, the artifact is meant to be shared, or interaction/export controls would help the user stay in the loop.
- Route by product job first, then choose the format. Do not create a generic HTML workflow when a Productize playbook, gate, or routed skill owns the work.
- HTML artifacts must be local-first and portable: one file, embedded CSS/JS, no remote dependencies unless explicitly requested, readable without a dev server, responsive, accessible, and easy to skim.
- Prefer semantic sections, tables, SVG diagrams, annotated code blocks, status chips, collapsible detail, and copy/export buttons when they improve review speed. Avoid decorative complexity that hides the decision.
- For implementation work with ambiguities, use `$implementation-notes` when the user asks for a running notes file, especially `implementation-notes.html` or `implementation-notes.md`.

Runtime hooks, if available:

- Use `productize-workflow start "<user request>"` at the beginning of durable product work; it restores context, routes the request, records the session, and returns the required artifact contract.
- Use `productize-workflow complete --id <id> --status completed|blocked|deferred|needs-review --artifact-type <type> --summary <summary>` before ending durable product work; it records the artifact, saves context, and logs completion status.
- Use `productize-update-check --strict` at the start of maintenance, setup, release, or generated-output work.
- Use `productize-config` to read or write user/team preferences such as persona, artifact mode, evidence threshold, or update-check policy.
- Use `productize-session-log` to record important workflow decisions.
- Use `productize-artifact-log` when a durable artifact is produced.
- Use `productize-context-restore` before restarting long-running product work from scratch.
- Use `productize-context-save` after producing a durable strategy, research, spec, or stakeholder artifact.
- Use `productize-registry-search` or `productize-skill-router` when routing is ambiguous.
- Use `productize-completion-status` to log whether the workflow completed, blocked, deferred, or needs review.

Telemetry standard:

- Keep telemetry local by default in `.productize/` or `PRODUCTIZE_STATE_DIR`.
- Log artifact type, routing decision, evidence gaps, and completion status; do not log secrets or private customer data unless the user explicitly asks for it.

Current skill metadata:

- **Skill**: `tdd`
- **Lifecycle**: Build With AI
- **Category**: AI Execution
- **Primary artifact**: TDD AI-builder handoff with implementation scope, verification plan, and risks

Use when implementing any feature or bugfix, before writing implementation code.

## Implementation Notes Hook

If the user asks for a running implementation notes file, activate
`$implementation-notes` before writing production code. Keep the notes current
whenever a test or implementation choice interprets an ambiguous spec, departs
from the spec, accepts a tradeoff, or leaves an open question for the user.

Do not let the notes file replace TDD. The test still comes first; the notes record
why the chosen behavior is the right interpretation of the spec.

## The Iron Law

```
NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

Write code before the test? Delete it. Start over.

**No exceptions:**
- Don't keep it as "reference"
- Don't "adapt" it while writing tests
- Delete means delete

## Red-Green-Refactor

### RED - Write Failing Test
Write one minimal test showing what should happen.
- One behavior
- Clear name
- Real code (no mocks unless unavoidable)

### Verify RED - Watch It Fail
**MANDATORY. Never skip.**
- Run the test, confirm it fails (not errors)
- Failure message is expected
- Test passes? You're testing existing behavior. Fix test.

### GREEN - Minimal Code
Write simplest code to pass the test.
- Just enough to pass
- No extra features
- Don't add behavior beyond the test

### Verify GREEN - Watch It Pass
**MANDATORY.**
- Test passes
- Other tests still pass
- Output pristine (no errors, warnings)

### REFACTOR - Clean Up
After green only:
- Remove duplication
- Improve names
- Extract helpers
Keep tests green. Don't add behavior.

## Why Order Matters

**"I'll write tests after"**
Tests written after pass immediately. Passing immediately proves nothing. Test-first forces you to see the test fail, proving it actually tests something.

**"Tests after achieve same goals"**
No. Tests-after answer "What does this do?" Tests-first answer "What should this do?"

**"Deleting X hours of work is wasteful"**
Sunk cost fallacy. The time is gone. The waste is keeping code you can't trust.

## Red Flags - STOP and Start Over

- Code before test
- Test after implementation
- Test passes immediately
- "I already manually tested it"
- "Tests after achieve the same purpose"
- "This is different because..."

**All mean: Delete code. Start over with TDD.**

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Too simple to test" | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds. |
| "I'll test after" | Tests passing immediately prove nothing. |
| "Already manually tested" | Ad-hoc is not systematic. No record, can't re-run. |
| "TDD will slow me down" | TDD faster than debugging later. |

## Verification Checklist

Before marking work complete:
- [ ] Every new function/method has a test
- [ ] Watched each test fail before implementing
- [ ] Each test failed for expected reason
- [ ] Wrote minimal code to pass each test
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Output pristine (no errors, warnings)

Can't check all boxes? You skipped TDD. Start over.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the task directly matches the workflow described above.

## When Not to Use

Do not use this skill when the request is unrelated, low-stakes, or better handled by a simpler direct response.

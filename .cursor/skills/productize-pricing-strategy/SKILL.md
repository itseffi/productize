# Pricing Strategy

## Productize Preamble

Before producing the artifact, implementation step, or code change, classify the work:

- **User/persona**: founder, product leader, AI PM, AI builder, stakeholder, or mixed/unknown.
- **Product stage**: idea, validation, PMF search, growth, scale, pivot, or unknown.
- **Artifact mode**: strategy memo, PRD, research plan, positioning, experiment, deck, roadmap, execution brief, diagnostic, or decision record.
- **Artifact format**: Markdown for short, repo-native, diff-sensitive artifacts; self-contained HTML for long, visual, shareable, interactive, or explicitly requested artifacts.
- **Evidence standard**: what is known, assumed, missing, and risky.
- **Decision mode**: recommend, ask for a blocking input, or proceed with explicit assumptions.

Operating rules:

1. Do not produce generic product strategy filler. Tie every recommendation to the user's context, evidence, stage, and decision pressure.
2. Separate facts from assumptions. Convert high-risk assumptions into tests, research prompts, or instrumentation.
3. Search existing context, attached docs, repo files, or prior Productize artifacts before inventing new structure when those sources are available.
4. Ask only for inputs that materially change the output. If the next step is obvious, proceed and state assumptions.
5. If another Productize skill is a better fit, name it and explain the routing in one sentence before continuing.
6. Enforce the output contract for this skill. Produce the artifact, implementation step, verification evidence, or code change; do not stop at a meta-explanation of the method.
7. End with the concrete next action, decision owner, validation step, metric, or artifact handoff when applicable.
8. Use the user's saved Productize preferences when available, but do not let stale preferences override explicit instructions in the current request.
9. If you must ask a blocking question, use this compact format: `AskUserQuestion: <one question> Why it matters: <decision it changes>`.
10. Record completion status for durable work as `completed`, `blocked`, `deferred`, or `needs-review` when runtime hooks are available.

Artifact format policy:

- Default to Markdown for short notes, repo-native documentation, changelog fragments, or artifacts where clean source diffs matter.
- Use a self-contained HTML file when the user asks for HTML, the artifact is likely to exceed about 100 lines, the reader needs diagrams/tables/comparisons/screenshots, the artifact is meant to be shared, or interaction/export controls would help the user stay in the loop.
- Route by product job first, then choose the format. Do not create a generic HTML workflow when a Productize playbook, reviewer, or routed skill owns the work.
- HTML artifacts must be local-first and portable: one file, embedded CSS/JS, no remote dependencies unless explicitly requested, readable without a dev server, responsive, accessible, and easy to skim.
- Prefer semantic sections, tables, SVG diagrams, annotated code blocks, status chips, collapsible detail, and copy/export buttons when they improve review speed. Avoid decorative complexity that hides the decision.
- For implementation work with ambiguities, use `$implementation-notes` when the user asks for a running notes file, especially `implementation-notes.html` or `implementation-notes.md`.

Runtime hooks, if available:

- Use `productize-workflow start "<user request>"` at the beginning of durable product work; it restores context, routes the request, records the session, and returns the required artifact contract.
- Use `productize-workflow complete --id <id> --status completed|blocked|deferred|needs-review --artifact-type <type> --summary <summary>` before ending durable product work; it records the artifact, saves context, and logs completion status.
- Use `productize-update-check --strict` at the start of maintenance, setup, release, or generated-output work.
- Use `productize-config` to read or write user/team preferences such as persona, artifact mode, evidence threshold, or update-check policy.
- Use `productize-session-log` to record important workflow decisions.
- Use `productize-artifact-log` when a durable artifact is produced.
- Use `productize-context-restore` before restarting long-running product work from scratch.
- Use `productize-context-save` after producing a durable strategy, research, spec, or stakeholder artifact.
- Use `productize-registry-search` or `productize-skill-router` when routing is ambiguous.
- Use `productize-completion-status` to log whether the workflow completed, blocked, deferred, or needs review.

Telemetry standard:

- Keep telemetry local by default in `.productize/` or `PRODUCTIZE_STATE_DIR`.
- Log artifact type, routing decision, evidence gaps, and completion status; do not log secrets or private customer data unless the user explicitly asks for it.

## Method

## Pricing Strategy

Design a pricing strategy grounded in value delivery, competitive positioning, and willingness to pay.

### Context

You are developing a pricing strategy for **$ARGUMENTS**.

If the user provides files (competitor pricing, survey data, financial models, or usage data), read them first. Use web search to research competitor pricing if needed.

### Instructions

1. **Understand the value delivered**:
   - What is the core value proposition?
   - What is the customer's alternative (and its cost)?
   - What quantifiable outcomes does the product deliver? (time saved, revenue gained, cost reduced)
   - What is the customer's willingness to pay based on that value?

2. **Evaluate pricing models** -- recommend the best fit:

   | Model | Best For | Example |
   |---|---|---|
   | **Flat-rate** | Simple products, predictable costs | Basecamp ($99/mo flat) |
   | **Per-seat** | Collaboration tools, team products | Slack, Figma |
   | **Usage-based** | Infrastructure, API products | AWS, Twilio |
   | **Tiered** | Products with distinct user segments | Most SaaS (Free/Pro/Enterprise) |
   | **Freemium** | Products with viral/network effects | Spotify, Notion |
   | **Freemium + usage** | Platform products | Vercel, OpenAI API |
   | **Value-based** | High-impact enterprise tools | Salesforce, Palantir |

3. **Analyze competitive pricing**:
   - Map competitor pricing tiers and what's included
   - Identify where your product sits (premium, mid-market, budget)
   - Find pricing gaps or opportunities
   - Note any industry pricing conventions

4. **Design the pricing structure**:
   - **Tiers**: Define 2-4 tiers with clear differentiation
   - **Feature gating**: Which features go in which tier? (Use value metrics, not arbitrary limits)
   - **Value metric**: What unit do you charge on? (users, events, storage, API calls)
   - **Anchor pricing**: Set the most popular tier to feel like the obvious choice
   - **Annual discount**: Typically 15-20% off monthly pricing

5. **Estimate price sensitivity**:
   - Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter (if survey data available):
     - Too cheap -> quality concerns
     - Cheap -> good value
     - Expensive -> starting to hesitate
     - Too expensive -> won't buy
   - Alternatively, estimate based on competitor pricing and value delivered

6. **Plan pricing experiments**:
   - A/B test pricing pages (different price points, tier names, feature bundles)
   - Founder-led sales conversations to test willingness to pay
   - Landing page tests with different price anchors
   - Cohort analysis of conversion rates by price point

7. **Output a pricing recommendation**:
   ```
   Recommended Model: [Model type]
   Value Metric: [What you charge on]

   | Tier | Price | Target Segment | Key Features | Positioning |
   |---|---|---|---|---|

   Key Assumptions:
   - [Assumption] -> [How to test]

   Risks:
   - [Risk] -> [Mitigation]
   ```

Think step by step. Save as markdown. Flag any assumptions that need validation before launch.

## Productize Output Rules

- Produce the artifact named in the Productize contract, not a generic framework summary.
- Separate known facts, assumptions, missing evidence, and risky leaps before recommending.
- Convert uncertain claims into validation steps, metrics, owner decisions, or launch/readout checks.
- If the PM source method conflicts with Productize evidence standards, keep the Productize standard.
